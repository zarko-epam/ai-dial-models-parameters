# TODO:
#  Try different models (`deployment_name`) with such user request:
#  User massage: What LLMs can do?

# Models to try:
# - gpt-4o
# - claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219
# - gemini-2.5-pro

# The main goal of this task is to explore the functional capabilities of DIAL to be able to work with different
# LLMs through unified API
